Dragon Adventure - 2D C++ Game
Welcome to Dragon Adventure, a 2D arcade-style game developed in C++ 
using the custom-built SGG library. This project demonstrates not only 
strong programming principles but also includes carefully crafted graphical 
effects and a well-tested gameplay experience.

üïπÔ∏è How to Play
Start: Press Enter to begin the game.
Initial Movement: For the first minute, movement is limited to up and down only.
Full Movement Activation: After one minute, full directional movement is unlocked,
 and new challenges emerge as bombs begin falling from the sky.

Gameplay:
Avoid: Steer clear of jets and birds to keep your dragon safe.
Collect: Gather hearts to restore health and coins to boost your score.
Survive: Avoid falling bombs after the first minute.
‚ú® Features and Highlights
Parallax Scrolling Effect: To add depth and a dynamic experience, the game 
incorporates parallax scrolling for a more immersive background.
Strong Programming and Graphics Principles: Built with robust programming practices, 
the game also incorporates strong graphics principles, resulting in an engaging and 
visually appealing experience.
Algorithmic Randomness: Different algorithms manage the random spawning of objects
like jets, birds, hearts, and bombs, each with its own unique properties and 
behaviors.

Object-Specific Properties: Each game object (e.g., the dragon, enemies, coins) 
has unique characteristics that affect gameplay, making each session unpredictable
 and challenging.

üß™ Testing and Optimization
Extensive testing was conducted to ensure smooth gameplay, fair spawn rates, and 
balanced difficulty progression. These tests helped in optimizing performance, 
ensuring responsiveness in handling rapid player inputs, and refining the collision 
mechanics for a fair gaming experience.

üöÄ Getting Started
Requirements: The game is built using the SGG library and C++. Make sure you have 
a compatible environment.
Controls: Use the arrow keys to control the dragon's movement.
Objective: Survive as long as possible by dodging obstacles and collecting items 
to increase your score.
üìö Additional Notes
This game provides a unique balance between classic arcade excitement and 
strategic dodging mechanics. Each playthrough is a new challenge thanks to 
randomized object spawning, carefully calculated for an unpredictable and fun 
experience. This project demonstrates well-applied programming techniques in game 
design, including encapsulation, algorithmic efficiency, and responsive graphics.
